IGetHouse Word Puzzle ‚Äì Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-09-03
Owner: IGetHouse Product Team
Status: Draft ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Build

1) Summary

Build a fast, mobile-first word search puzzle game that teaches users real-estate concepts while driving traffic and leads to IGetHouse. The game runs entirely on the front end (HTML5 + TailwindCSS + Vanilla JavaScript) with no backend and no CDN. Users choose a category (e.g., Property Types, Mortgage & Finance, Home Interior & Decor, Legal & Documentation, Locations in Nigeria, etc.); the app generates a grid with hidden words from that category; users select letters to find words. CTAs, tips, and share actions tie discovery back to IGetHouse listings and content.

2) Objectives & Rationale

Educate: Familiarize users with real-estate terms, processes, and Nigeria-specific context.

Engage: Provide a sticky, gamified experience to increase time-on-site and return visits.

Convert: Drive users to IGetHouse funnels (NHF information, mortgage partners, listings pages, contact forms, WhatsApp/chat).

Delight: Smooth, responsive UX that feels premium and brand-consistent.

Non-goals (v1): account login, server-side leaderboards, multi-player, real-time sync, CMS-backed word lists.

3) Success Metrics (KPIs)

Average Session Length: ‚â• 3:30 mins

Puzzle Completion Rate: ‚â• 45% (per session)

CTA Click-Through (post-win modal): ‚â• 8%

Return Rate (7-day): ‚â• 20%

Daily Challenge Plays: ‚â• 500/day (site-wide)

Share Rate (WA/X): ‚â• 5%

4) Target Users & Personas

Curious Buyer (Gen Z/Young Professional): learning basics; loves quick games + shareability.

Active House Hunter: browsing listings; appreciates tips that reduce research time.

Investor/Landlord: interested in ROI/finance/legal categories; enjoys higher difficulty.

6) User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

US-01: Pick category
As a player, I can choose a category to load a themed puzzle.

Given the landing screen, when I click a category tile, then the game loads a new grid with 10‚Äì15 words from that category and shows the side word list.

US-02: Play & select words
As a player, I can select contiguous letters to mark a word.

Drag or click-start ‚Üí click-end highlights a path in the 8 directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

If the selection matches a hidden word, it locks and the word is ticked off.

US-03: Difficulty
As a player, I can choose Easy/Medium/Hard.

Easy: 8√ó8 grid, 8‚Äì10 words, no backwards, horizontal/vertical only.

Medium: 12√ó12 grid, 12‚Äì14 words, includes diagonals and backward words.

Hard: 15√ó15 grid, 14‚Äì16 words, all directions + higher letter noise.

US-04: Hints
As a player, I can consume limited hints to progress.

Hint reveals the first letter cell of a random unfound word or pulses the line-of-sight for that word for 1.5s.

Default 2 hints per puzzle; using hints reduces max score.

US-05: Timer & Score
As a player, I see a timer and score update.

Score increases per word; time bonus; hint penalty.

On completion: show final score with share options.

US-06: Completion & CTA
As a player, I see a celebration and a contextual CTA.

Modal: üéâ confetti, completion time/score, CTA buttons (e.g., ‚ÄúBrowse Lagos Apartments‚Äù), and Play Again.

US-07: Daily Challenge
As a player, I can play a once-per-day puzzle that is the same for all users.

Seed = SHA256('IGETHOUSE-'+YYYYMMDD+'CATEGORY') to generate the same grid for the day.

US-08: Persistence
As a player, my last difficulty, sound, and streaks are remembered locally.

Stored with localStorage keys; no PII is stored.

US-09: Accessibility

Full keyboard navigation; visible focus; ARIA roles; color not sole cue.
